# Offerta-Front-End-Challenge
Test task for Offerta


Demonstration page can be seen at https://alevyt.github.io/Offerta-Front-End-Challenge.github.io/


Due to lack of time I was not able to implement some features. Possible improvements would be:

- adding unitests
- making output element as separated component, incapsulating all functionality and allowing reusability
- improving font-size scaling algorithm (possible option would be using recursion)
- adding some good looking styles
